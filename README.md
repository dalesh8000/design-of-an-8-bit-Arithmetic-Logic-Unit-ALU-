# design-of-an-8-bit-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-ALU-
The objective of this project is to design and implement an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that efficiently performs a variety of arithmetic and logical operations essential for digital computing. The ALU will be capable of executing operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
